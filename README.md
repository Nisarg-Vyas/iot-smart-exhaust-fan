# iot-smart-exhaust-fan
This is my first hardware+software project while I started my CSE, built in my Sem-1. IoT-enabled Smart Exhaust Fan using ESP32, DHT11, MQ135, and Blynk IoT platform. Automatically turns on based on temperature, humidity, or air quality levels, with manual control from the Blynk dashboard.
